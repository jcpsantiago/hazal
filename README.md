[AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) relies on docker containers for its pipelines.
This means it's possible to create custom containers using e.g. other languages than Python or algorithms not available off-the-shelf in AWS.
Even though it's easy to test each container in isolation, it is harder to test the whole pipeline in one go.
`hazal` helps by orchestrating the communication between containers.

## TODO

- [x] Define configuration structure
- [x] Chain an arbitrary number of containers
- [ ] Differentiate between single and multi-model containers
- [ ] Send request to load model, if necessary
